-   Detecting the entities from the text
-   Classifying them into different categories

## Application of NER
- Sentiment analysis
- Question Answering
- Information Extraction

## Challenges
- Segmentation
	- In [[POS tagging]]
- Type ambiguity

## NER method
- BIO Tagging
- Hidden Markov Models
- multi-class classification
- conditional random field (CRF)/Maximum Entropy Markov Models (MEMM)
- deep learning based NER
- neural sequence models (RNNs or Transformers)
- Finetune Large Language Models (BERT)
