#statistics 

$$\text{p value} = P(\text{observed sample statistics} | H_0\text{ is true})$$
Therefore, if p_value <= 0.05, it means it is very unlikely we observe this sample statistics given $H_0$ is true, therefore we can reject the null hypothesis.

if p_value >= 0.05, it means it's likely we observe this sample statistics given $H_0$ is true, therefore we can not reject the null hypothesis.
