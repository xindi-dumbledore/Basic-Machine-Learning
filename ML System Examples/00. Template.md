## Clarifying Requirements (5min)
- Business objective
- Is the data text, images, videos?
- What data is available? Labeled data? User interaction data?
- Multiple languages?
- Personalized?
- Scale of the system? 10 billion videos? 3 billion users for facebook (world population about 8 billion)
- Latency? 200 milliseconds?
**Spit out your assumptions directly rather than asking the question explicitly**
**Write problem statement so everyone's on the same page.**
## Frame it as an ML task (5min)
- ML objective
- I/O
- ML category
## Data (8-9min)
### What
- What are your labels?
- What are your features?
### Preparation
- How to represent data?
- How to split your dataset?
- How to deal with imbalances?
- Feature engineering
- Data augmentation
## Model development (15min)
- Modeling: give 1 or 2 example and discuss pros and cons
- Loss function and metrics
- Training
- Overfitting and other issues (e.g. cold start, class imbalance, time travel problems)
## Evaluation
### Offline Evaluation
- Regression
- Classification
- Ranking
### Online Evaluation
e.g. CTR, explicit feedback (like, subscribe etc.), total engaging time etc.
## Serving (5min)
- Components we have in the system
- Batch prediction or online prediction
- How do we decrease latency
## Other talking points
## Ask the interviewer questions
- What's a typical day of your job?
- What's the one thing you like about your job, and what do you think can have some improvements
