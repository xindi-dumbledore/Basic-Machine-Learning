## Description
User enters text into the search box, and the system displays the most relevant videos for the given text.
## Clarifying Requirements
- Is the query text only?
- What information of the video we can use? Video itself, some meta data (tags, title, description, popularity etc.)
- What kind of data is available? <video, text query>
- How many videos are there on the platform? One billion videos
- Do we need to personalized results for users? No

## Frame it as an ML task
- ML objective: retrieve videos that are most relevant to the text query, rank them from most relevant to least relevant.
- I/O: input - user query, output - list of videos ranked from most relevant to least relevant
- ML category
	- Since we are using both the video content and the video metadata, we can have two search system: visual search and text search, then fuse them together to generate the final result
	- Visual search: use to encoders to transfer query and video into embeddings, then we can calculate the similarity between the embeddings ![[Screenshot 2025-04-01 at 13.15.29.png]]
	- Text search: We can use inverted index techniques for text search. A popular choice is to use Elastic Search. For this training is not needed.
## Data
### What
- Our data are <query, video> pairs which looks something like this
	- query, video id
### Preparation
#### Query processing
We need to convert text queries to numerical values. To do that, see [[Text Preprocessing]] and [[Vocabulary & Feature Extraction]]. We can perform:
- text normalization: remove stop words, lemmatization and stemming
- tokenization
- token to ID
#### Video processing

### Model details
### Text encoder
For text encoder, we can use simple statistical method (BoW, TF-IDF), more advanced methods like [[Word2Vec]] and [[Transformer]] to convert query into embeddings. Statistical method are fast but didn't take much contextual and semantic information. Word2Vec is more advanced but will produce same embedding for the same word under different context. Transformers are more powerful and more suited to this task. For more information, see [[Vocabulary & Feature Extraction]].
