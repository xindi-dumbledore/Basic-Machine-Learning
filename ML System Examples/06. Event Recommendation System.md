Event recommendation system similar to Eventbrite.

Key: Unlike recommending videos, event happens during a short timeframe, and will expire. Additionally, location is highly important for event recommendation.
## Clarifying Requirements
- Business objective: increase ticket sales
- What data is available? 
	- Hand-labeled data?
	- Do we have user's past events? What interaction can users have? RSVP, add to list?
	- Can users become friends on the platform? Can users invite others to the event?
	- Do we have textual description of the event, time, location and price?
- Scale of the system? How many events? How many users?
**Problem statement** We want to design an event recommendation system, which display a list of events to users. The goal is to increase ticket sales. Events only exist in a timeframe and will be expired afterwards. We have access to user's past registration records. Users can also be friends on the platform, and can invite others to events. We will be using these information to construct the dataset.
