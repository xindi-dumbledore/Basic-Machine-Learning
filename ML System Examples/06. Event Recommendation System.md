Event recommendation system similar to Eventbrite.

Key: Unlike recommending videos, event happens during a short timeframe, and will expire. Additionally, location is highly important for event recommendation.

Events are typically short-lived, meaning the time is short between event creation and when it finishes. As a result, there are not many historical interactions available for a given event. For this reason, event-based recommendations are intrinsically cold-start and suffer from a constant new-item problem.
## Clarifying Requirements
- Business objective: increase ticket sales
- What data is available? 
	- Hand-labeled data?
	- Do we have user's past events? What interaction can users have? RSVP, add to list?
	- Can users become friends on the platform? Can users invite others to the event?
	- Do we have textual description of the event, time, location and price?
- Scale of the system? How many events? How many users?
**Problem statement** We want to design an event recommendation system, which display a list of events to users. The goal is to increase ticket sales. Events only exist in a timeframe and will be expired afterwards. We have access to user's past registration records. Users can also be friends on the platform, and can invite others to events. We will be using these information to construct the dataset.
## Frame it as an ML task
- ML objective: maximize event registrations
- I/O
![[Pasted image 20250408140606.png]]
- ML category: ranking model
## Data
- Labels: user, event -> register or not
	- for positive samples, we have them directly
	- for negative samples, we can sample from background distribution
		- hard negatives: event has impression but not registered; event close to user's location
- Features
	- User features
		- demographic features: age, gender, location
		- past registration history
			- category: we can convert category into an embedding, and aggregate them
			- description: get aggregated embedding for this
			- price: average price of past registered events
			- distance: average distance of past registered events
	- Event features:
		- location related features
			- walk score, walk score similarity
			- transit score, transit score similarity
			- bike score, bike score similarity
		- distance
		- estimated travel time
		- category: embedding
		- description: embedding
		- popularity (how many people registered)
		- time left till event start
		- day of the week
			- day of the week similarity
		- time of the day
			- time of the day similarity
		- price
		- Is the user invited by friends
		- Any friends registered to this event
		- is host user's friend
## Model development
- Modeling
	- There are three different approaches to develop a ranking model
		- Pointwise: convert the problem to classification. Generate a relevance score for <user, event> pair
		- Pairwise: predict for two event, which one is better
		- Listwise: generate ranking from a list of event
		- Pairwise and Listwise is more difficult and expensive to train and deploy, let's choose pointwise for a starting point
	- For pointwise, we are basically developing a binary classification model to predict the relevance score for a <user, event> pair, common classification algorithms includes
		- Logistic regression
			- Pros: fast to train, interpretable
			- Cons: very simple model, can't handle non-linearity very well, probably not good performance
		- Decision tree
			- Pros: fast to train, interpretable
			- Cons: tend to overfit, Non-optimal decision boundary (decision tree models produce decision boundaries that are parallel to the axes in the feature space),  probably not good performance
		- Random forest (bagging)
			- Pros: prevent overfit, better performance, not too expensive to train
			- Cons: harder to interpret, might underfit
		- Gradient Boosting Tree (boosting)
			- Pros: reduce both bias and variance, better performance
			- Cons: hard to interpret, slower to train, hard to do continual learning
		- Neural network
			- Pros: good performance, can do continual learning
			- Cons: more expensive to train, need a lot of data, can't interpret
	- Suggestion: we can have boosting method such as XGBoost as a baseline, and if resources permits, we can explore neural network and compare the results
- Loss function
	- Cross entropy since we are doing binary classification
	- Class imbalance problem
		- Undersample majority class
		- Weight the loss: focal loss
## Evaluation
Offline
- Ranking measures: Precision@k, recall@k, mAP
Online
- CTR, register rate, bookmark rate, revenue lift
## Serving
Multi-stage process:
- Filter to get candidates: only getting events that is in the future, close to the user, or user specified filters (event category etc.)
- Rank the candidates: use the ranking model to rank the events
