## Use-case
The system recommends videos on the user's homepage based on their profile, previous interactions, etc., just like Youtube

## Clarifying requirements
- Business objective: increase user engagement
- Where is the recommendation system used? Homepage
- Can we assume the data is constructed from user interactions?
- How many videos are available on the platform? 10 billion
- Does it need to support various languages?
- How fast should the system be? 200 milliseconds
**Problem statement** Design a homepage video recommendation system to increase user engagement. Each time user logged on the system, it will recommend the most engaging videos. Users are from different regions and videos can be in different languages. There are approximately 10 billion videos and we want the system to be served within 200 milliseconds.
## Frame it as an ML task
- ML objective: maximize the number of relevance videos. Relevance can be defined based on some rules, e.g. if users press "like" button or user watches half of it.
- I/O

- ML category: It's a recommendation problem so we can use content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, or hybrid filtering. We choose hybrid filtering. To see more details see [[Recommendation Systems]]
## Data
### What
Because we want to do hybrid filtering, we need three kinds of information
- User: id, age, gender, country, city, language, timezone
- Video: id, duration, tags, title, description, likes, views, language
- User-video interaction: user id, video id, interaction type, interaction value, location, timestamp, device
### Preparation
#### Feature engineering
**Video features**
- id: categorical feature, we can use an embedding layer to represent it
- duration: continuous variable, we can do scaling on this
- title, tags, descriptions: natural language features, we can use some embedding model to convert them into embeddings
- language: categorical feature, we can use an embedding layer to represent it

**User features**
- id, country, city, language can use an embedding layer to represent them each
- age: we can have buckets for ages and then use one-hot encoding
- gender: binary feature, one-hot encoding

**Contextual features**
- time
	- time of day: use buckets and one-hot encoding
	- day of week: use embedding
- device: one-hot encoding for computer or mobile etc.

**Historical interactions**
- Search history: use pre-trained model to map search queries into embeddings then aggregate them
- Liked videos, watched videos and impressions: we map those video IDs into embedding vectors and aggregate them for each category

## Model details
We can choose matrix factorization or two-tower network for this application. For more details see [[Recommendation Systems]].
## Evaluation
### Offline metrics
- Precision@k: proportion of relevant videos among the top k recommended videos
- mAP: Precision@k doesn't take into account the ranking positions, where mAP will handle that.
- Diversity: how dissimilar recommended videos are to each other. This metric is important to track, as users are more interested in diversified recommendation. To measure diversity, we calculate the average pairwise similarity (e.g. cosine similarity) between videos in the list. A low average pairwise similarity score indicates the list is more diverse.
For more ranking metrics see [[Learning to Rank Evaluation Measures]]
### Online metrics
- Click through rate
- Watch time of recommended videos
- Number of watched videos
- Explicit feedbacks: like, share, comment etc
## Serving
Given we have billions of videos on the platform and requirement of fast service, **we can do a multi-stage design to balance both speed and accuracy.**
![[Pasted image 20250406154051.png]]
- Stage 1: Candidate generation. 
	- Goal: Use a lightweight model to narrow down the pool for recommendation. In this stage, **we want to narrow down the pool from billions of videos to thousands of videos**.
	- Choice: we can use a two-tower network but without video features. A two-tower network will enable us to handle new users, but not too heavy because we don't use video features. Essentially, we are using the user-encoder and pre-calculated embeddings for videos to find the nearest neighbors.
	- Notes: in practice, companies might have various candidate generation services focusing on different aspects, e.g. one for relevant videos, one for popular videos etc.
![[Pasted image 20250406154104.png]]
- Stage 2: Candidate scoring (i.e. ranking).
	- Goal: Use a more accurate model to score the candidates.
	- Choice: we use a two tower network with both user and video features to achieve more accurate results.
![[Pasted image 20250406154115.png]]
- Stage 3: Reranking
	- Goal: additional filters and constraints. For example, we might want to filter out a video that is a click-bait or has harmful information. Another thing is to remove duplicate or near-duplicate videos.
