## Usecase
The system recommends videos on the user's homepage based on their profile, previous interactions, etc. just like Youtube

## Clarifying requirements
- Business objective: increase user engagement
- Where is the recommendation system used? Homepage
- Can we assume the data is constructed from user interactions?
- How many videos are available on the platform? 10 billion
- Does it need to support various languages?
- How fast should the system be? 200 milliseconds
Problem statement: design a homepage video recommendation system to increase user engagement. Each time user logged on the system, it will recommend the most engaging videos. Users are from different regions and videos can be in different languages. There are approximately 10 billion videos and we want the system to be served within 200 milliseconds.
## Frame it as an ML task
- ML objective: maximize the number of relevance videos. Relevance can be defined based on some rules, e.g. if users press "like" button or user watches half of it.
- I/O

- ML category: It's a recommendation problem so we can use content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, or hybrid filtering. We choose hybrid filtering. To see more details see [[Recommendation Systems]]
## Data
### What
Because we want to do hybrid filtering, we need three kinds of information
- User: id, age, gender, country, city, language, timezone
- Video: id, duration, tags, title, description, likes, views, language
- User-video interaction: user id, video id, interaction type, interaction value, location, timestamp, device
### Preparation
#### Feature engineering
Video features
- id: categorical feature, we can use an embedding layer to represent it
- duration: continuous variable, we can do scaling on this
- title, tags, descriptions: natural language features, we can use some embedding model to convert them into embeddings
- language: categorical feature, we can use an embedding layer to represent it

User features
- id, country, city, language can use an embedding layer to represent them each
- age: we can have buckets for ages and then use one-hot encoding
- gender: binary feature, one-hot encoding

contexual features
- time
	- time of day: use buckets and one-hot encoding
	- day of week: use embedding
- device: one-hot encoding for computer or mobile etc.

Historical interactions
- Search history: use pre-trained model to map search queries into embeddings then aggregate them
- Liked videos, watched videos and impressions: we map those video IDs into embedding vectors and aggregate them for each category
