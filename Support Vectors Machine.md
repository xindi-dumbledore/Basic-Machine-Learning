### High Level Summary
Support Vectors Machine (SVC) is a supervised algorithm that aims to find a hyperplane in an N-dimensional space(N â€” the number of features) that distinctly classifies the data points.

Our objective is to find a plane that has the maximum margin, i.e the maximum distance between data points of both classes. Maximizing the margin distance provides some reinforcement so that future data points can be classified with more confidence.

Soft Margin Classifier

The observations on the edge and within the soft margin are called support vectors.
