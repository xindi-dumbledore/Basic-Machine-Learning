#LLM 
LLM Evaluation is tricky, because language is tricky. Two sentences can mean the same thing but looks drastically different; Seemingly very similar sentences can have opposite meaning.
```
Mike really loves drinking tea = Mike adores sipping tea.
Mike does not drink coffee != Mike does drink coffee.
```
