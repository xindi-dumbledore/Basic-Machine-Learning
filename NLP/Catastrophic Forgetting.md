- What is Catastrophic Forgetting: Fine-tuning can increase the performance of a model on a specific task but can lead to reduction in ability on other tasks
- How to avoid
	- Fine-tune on multiple tasks at the same time
	- Consider [[Parameter Efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT)]]
- Catastrophic forgetting might not always be bad, maybe it's fine that the model is not generalizable in some scenario
