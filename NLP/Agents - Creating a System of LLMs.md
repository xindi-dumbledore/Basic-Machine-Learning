One of the most promising concepts in LLMs is their ability to determine the actions they can take. This idea is often called agents, systems that leverage a language model to determine which actions they should take and in what order. The driving force of many agent-based systems is the use of a framework called Reasoning and Acting (ReAct).

## ReAct
The framework consists of iteratively following these three steps:
- Thought
- Action
- Observation
