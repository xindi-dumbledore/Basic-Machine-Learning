Model selection is the process of selecting one from among a collection of candidate machine learning models for a training dataset. Model selection is a process that can be applied both across different types of models (e.g. logistic regression, SVM, KNN, etc.) and across models of the same type configured with different model hyperparameters (e.g. different kernels in an SVM).
